# Wordpress-Plugin-for-Book-Search
Plugin is based on library book search.

I have used WPPB boiler plate to complete the task,

Extract the files to the plugin folder in the wordpress.
Activate in the admin backend.
You can see an option library books where you can create new books.
After creating few books,
Add this shortcode [book_display_and_filter] inside the page where you want to see the search from and books.

It has,
Price, 
ISBN Number, 
Date added to library, 
Source, 
Rights, 
Published Year, 
Rating, 
Language

as an custom meta box 

And Genre, Author also Publisher as taxonomy

Totally i have taken 5 hours to complete the task,
1. Creating the Backend - 1 hr
2. Creating the front-end form, ajax search, filters etc - 4 hrs
